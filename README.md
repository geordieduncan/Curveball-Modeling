# Curveball-Modeling
A python program that allows users to punch in various statistics about the release of a pitch and watch the flight of the ball

Requirements:
python2.7
matplotlib
numpy
math

Usage:
'>>pos(velocity (meters per second), angular velocity (radians per second), horizontal release angle (radians), vertical release angle (radians), spin angle(radians), coeffecient of accuracy = 250)'

additional argumets for mass and radius of the ball can be chosen for non baseball specific modeling
